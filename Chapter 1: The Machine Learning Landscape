What is machine leaning
Machine learning is the science of programming coputers so that they can learn from data

Types of Machine learning System 

  1. Supervised 
  2. Unsupervised 
  3. Batch and Online learning 
  4. Instance based vs model based



  1. Supervised
			1.1	the traning set you feed to the algorith includes the desired solution called : LABELS
			1.2 Classification is a subervised learning task - E.g spam filter
			1.3 predict a target numeric value - e.g srock prices
			1.4 Supervised learning algorithms
					1.4.1 K- Nearest Neighbours 
					1.4.2 Linear regression
					1.4.3 Logistic regression 
					1.4.4 Support vector machines (SVM)
					1.4.5 Decision tree and random forest
					1.4.6 NEural n/w s

	2. Un supervised learning
			2.1	trainig data is unlabled - the system tries to learn without a teacher
			2.2 Un Supervised learning algorithms
					2.2.1 Clustering
								- K-means
								- DBSCAN 
								- Hirerchical Cluster Analysis (HCA)
					2.2.2 Anomoly detection and novelty detection
